# LSM9DS1-I2C
Python library for LSM9DS1 I2C.


# What is LSM9DS1
The LSM9DS1 is a system-in-package featuring a 3D digital linear acceleration sensor, a 3D digital angular rate sensor, and a 3D digital magnetic sensor.

The LSM9DS1 has a linear acceleration full scale of ±2g/±4g/±8/±16 g, a magnetic field full scale of ±4/±8/±12/±16 gauss and an angular rate of ±245/±500/±2000 dps.

The LSM9DS1 includes an I2C serial bus interface supporting standard and fast mode (100 kHz and 400 kHz) and an SPI serial standard interface.

Magnetic, accelerometer and gyroscope sensing can be enabled or set in power-down mode separately for smart power management.

The LSM9DS1 is available in a plastic land grid array package (LGA) and it is guaranteed to operate over an extended temperature range from -40 °C to +85 °C.
Tested with LSM9DS1(adafruit).
This library is compatible with any board.
